## Files Included

### `Final Project Code.R`

This script contains the full pipeline for my econometrics final project, exploring the **gender gap in campaign finance outcomes** among U.S. congressional candidates using DIME data (1979â€“2024).

**Key Features:**
- Filters for federal-level candidates and recodes gender, party affiliation, and incumbency.
- Constructs an ideological gap variable between donors and recipients.
- Uses `fixest` to run a three-stage fixed effects model across different contribution types:
  - Total contributions
  - Individual donations
  - PAC donations
  - Candidate self-contributions
  - Number of donors
- Includes interaction terms and controls for time and state fixed effects.
- Outputs publication-ready LaTeX tables via `etable()`.

Packages used: `readr`, `tidyverse`, `data.table`, `stargazer`, `fixest`  
Research topic: *Gender disparities in campaign finance under U.S. electoral institutions.*
